The project aims to predict the stock price of Reliance Industries for the next 30 days using historical data from 2015 to 2022. The process begins with collecting and preprocessing data, focusing on Open, High, Low, and Close prices. Time series analysis, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), is conducted to uncover short-term and long-term trends and identify patterns. The data is then split, with the last year set aside as a test set for evaluating machine learning models such as ARIMA or LSTM, which are trained to forecast stock prices. The analysis also considers external factors and significant events that may impact price movements. The project culminates in forecasting the stock prices and providing insights and recommendations for investors and stakeholders based on the model's predictions.
